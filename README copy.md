# SaaS website

## Overview

- *Fork this repository.*
- Code the whole SaaS website you designed in your Interaction Design course.
- Create a multi-page website: Home, Tour, Pricing & Sign-up.
- *It should have real text content*—**that you have written yourself.**
- It should be completely designed, with real images, real colours—and it should look amazing.
- *The website should obviously be fully responsive: working on screensizes from `320px` all the way to `~2500px`.*
- **Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.**

## Teacher’s expectations

This website is to prove that you—by yourself—can do everything we covered in class. Look back over all the assignments from the term, determine what kernel of knowledge they were trying to teach you, and see if you can implement it in this website.

There should be a significant example of everything we’ve learned this term in this website. **Leave the impression that you’re confident with what we’ve learned and can apply everything.**

## Markbot’s expectations

### All HTML files

- `header`, `header nav`, `header nav li`, `header nav a`
- `main`, `h2`, `div`, `img`, `footer`, `section` or `article`

  And many of the expected classes: `.grid`, `.unit`, `.xs-`, `.s-`, `.m-`, `.l-`, `.pad-`, `.push`, `.gutter`, `.list-group`, `.embed`, *font size classes*
- A Google Font
- A `color` or `background-color` hover state on the navigation
- A unique `<title>` & `<h1>` for everything HTML page
- Focus states on the navigation and links in the main body content
- ARIA roles & proper accessibility & colour contrast

### Only `index.html`

*Doesn’t have any specific requirements, but still must fulfill the general requirements.*

### Only `tour.html`

*Everything from “All HTML files” plus:*

- A `<table>` with all the appropriate tags.
  Maybe a feature comparison table.

### Only `sign-up.html`

*Everything from “All HTML files” plus:*

- A `<form>` that submits to Formspree, with all the appropriate tags.

### Only `pricing.html`

*Doesn’t have any specific requirements, but still must fulfill the general requirements.*

### CSS files

CSS requirements are really open—just make sure the CSS is valid & indented properly.

## Browser testing

In class, week 15, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a browser or validator and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit for grades using Markbot.

**When you submit to Progressinator, you’ll see a grey checkmark that shows the project was handed in.** You’ll still have to write a *Request for Grade* and the teacher will still be grading it personally.
